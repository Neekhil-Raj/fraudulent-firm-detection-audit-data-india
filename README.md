# 🕵️ Fraudulent Firm Detection Using Audit Data (India, 2015–2016)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to identify potentially **fraudulent firms** using one year of non-confidential audit data (2015–2016) sourced from the **Auditor Office of India**. The model is designed to support government auditors in identifying high-risk entities across various public and private sectors.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes audit records of firms spanning multiple sectors, with each record containing features extracted from:
- Historical audit data  
- Audit-paras (noted irregularities)  
- Environmental compliance reports  
- Firm reputation summaries  
- Ongoing issues and legal reports  
- Financial indicators (profit/loss)  
- Follow-up and re-audit findings

These features were shortlisted based on expert interviews with auditors, and their presence was estimated using historical and current audit records.

### 🔢 Sector-Wise Distribution of Firms

| Sector                 | Number of Firms |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Agriculture            | 200             |
| Irrigation             | 114             |
| Animal Husbandry       | 95              |
| Buildings and Roads    | 82              |
| Public Health          | 77              |
| Forest                 | 70              |
| Corporate              | 47              |
| Fisheries              | 41              |
| Industries             | 37              |
| Electrical             | 4               |
| Land                   | 5               |
| Science & Technology   | 3               |
| Communication          | 1               |
| Tourism                | 1               |

## 🧠 Problem Statement
**Given the features extracted from an audit report, predict whether a firm is fraudulent or not.**  
This is a **binary classification** task where the output is either `fraudulent` or `non-fraudulent`.

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Perform feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize fraud distribution by sector
   - Understand correlation between risk factors
   - Check for class imbalance

3. **Modeling**
   - Train using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Evaluate with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

4. **Model Explainability**
   - Feature importance using SHAP values

## 📈 Results

- Best model: `Random Forest`
- ROC-AUC: `0.92`
- F1-Score: `0.88`

### 🔑 Top Features
- Audit-paras
- Loss-value records
- Firm reputation
- Ongoing issue reports

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## 📦 Installation
